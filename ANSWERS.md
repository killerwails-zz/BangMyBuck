> What did you want to do but were unable to because you ran out of time?

-There are no tests, this pains me greatly
-It would have been nice not to use bootstrap or even spend more time getting the most out of the bootstrap I picked. 
-Having a proper code review and refactor. I am sure there are some inconsistencies in naming conventions etc.

>If you were given another 2 days what would you change?

-There would be proper test coverage.
-Perhaps taking it a step further and doing something like provision a server/deploy the app proper
-I would breakout the work of the creating the list of products to the backend. At the word ```ADD-ON``` I stopped reading, to my detriment. 
-The Google Map API has so many extra options that would have been nice to implement for better UI/UX ie: having a map with pins showing where the retailers are.
-While the basics of the challenge requirements are covered, there is more that could be done to make a more intuitive app. ie: bundle option: give a couple product bundles that spends the entirety of the amount of money inputted.

>How would you have approached the problem differently if you were to do it again?

-I would have started with the backend and worked forward. See above^^ about creating an API.
-TDD. React is still a relatively new thing for me. This is no excuse I know, but with a rush against time, testing always seems to be the first thing to go :/
